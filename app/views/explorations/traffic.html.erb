  <h1>Traffic Lights!  <small>How long should a traffic light stay on yellow? You be the judge.

<h2>The Problem</h2>

A traffic light has recently been installed on a busy
street. Remember:

<ul>
<li> A <b>green</b> light means "go."
<li> A <b>red</b> light means "stop."
<li> A <b>yellow</b> light is a transition between a green light and
a red light. 
</ul>
When the driver sees a yellow light, they must make a decision:
<ul>
<li> Should they slow down and stop at the impending red light?
<li> Or should the driver speed up and pass through the intersection?
<ul>
Let's see how you do at making this decision.

(YOU CONTROL WHETHER THE CAR GOES THROUGH INTERSECTION)

NOTE WE COULD DO A INTERACTIVE VIDEO AT THIS POINT

You have been put in charge of deciding how long a light stays yellow.
You want to help drivers safely pass through the intersection.

(YOU CONTROL LIGHT)


<h3>When is it possible to safely stop?</h3>

OK we start with the following equations

\[
x= v_0t+ \frac{at^2}{2}
\]

<h3>When must the driver accelerate through the intersection?</h3>
