        	<p class="problem">
        		A large whale suddenly materializes in the air above the nearest intersection, which you know to be <code><var>A</var></code> feet away from you. 
        		When the whale materializes it is at rest, but as the laws of physics dictate, the whale begins accelerating towards the Earth with an acceleration of about <code>32</code>
        		feet per second per second.  Intensely curious about the time of this occurrence, you grab a protractor and start taking measurements.
        		When you first manage to get a measurement, the angle between your line of sight with the whale and the horizontal is <code>\dfrac{\pi}{4}</code> and a tenth of a  second later, 
        		the angle has changed to <code>\dfrac{\pi}{4} - \dfrac{1}{<var>10*R</var>}</code>.  
        	</p>
        
        	<p class = "question">
        		Approximately how many seconds have elapsed between the time that the whale appeared and your first measurement?
        	</p>
        	
        	<p>
        		Hint:  First approximate the rate that the angle is changing with respect to time when you took your first measurement.
        	</p>
       	    <p class="solution" data-type="parsedExpression">
        		<var>A/(16*R)</var> 
            </p>
            <div class="hints">

            	<p>
            		Let <code>\theta</code> be the angle of your line of sight with the whale and the ground.  Let <code>y</code> be the height of the whale.

            	<p>
            		picture

            	</div>
            	<p>
            		Since <code>\theta</code> changes from <code>\dfrac{\pi}{4}</code> to <code>\dfrac{\pi}{4} - \dfrac{1}{<var>10*R</var>}</code> in a tenth of a second, we can estimate
            		that <code>\left. \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}}  \approx -\dfrac{ \frac{1}{<var>10*R</var>}}{\frac{1}{10}} = -\dfrac{1}{<var>R</var>}</code>
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		<b>Introduction</b>:  I will first use trigonometry to relate <code>\theta</code> and  <code>y</code>.  Then I will implicitly differentiate with respect to time, to obtain an equation
            		relating the rates.  This will allow me to figure out how fast the whale was falling at the time I took my first measurement.  Then, using the fact that the velocity of the whale started
            		at zero, and is increasing at a constant rate, I will be able to figure out how many seconds elapsed since the whale first materialized.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		By the definition of the tangent function, <code>\tan(\theta) = \dfrac{y}{<var>A</var>}</code>.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		Implicitly differentiating with respect to time I have <code>\dfrac{d}{dt}\tan(\theta) = \dfrac{d}{dt}\dfrac{y}{<var>A</var>}</code>.
            	</p>
            	<div>
            		<p>
            			<code>\dfrac{d}{d\theta}\left(\tan(\theta)\right) \cdot \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} =\dfrac{1}{<var>A</var>} \cdot \dfrac{dy}{dt}</code>, by the chain rule.
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			<code>\sec^2(\theta) \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} =\dfrac{1}{<var>A</var>} \cdot \dfrac{dy}{dt}</code>
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			<code>\dfrac{dy}{dt} = <var>A</var>\sec^2(\theta) \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}</code>
            		</p>
            		
            	</div>
            	<div>
            	<p>
            		At the time of the first measurement, <code>\theta = \dfrac{\pi}{4}</code>, so <code>\sec^2(\theta) = 2</code>.  We already estimated that  <code>\left. \dfrac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}}  \approx -\dfrac{1}{<var>R</var>}</code>.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		So <code>\left.\dfrac{dy}{dt}\right|_{\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}} \approx <var>A</var>\cdot 2 \cdot \dfrac{-1}{<var>R</var>}</code>
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		Now, I also know that the velocity is increasing at a constant rate of 32 ft/sec every second.  So it must have taken the whale <code>\dfrac{<var>A</var>\cdot 2 \cdot \dfrac{1}{<var>R</var>}}{32}</code> seconds to accelerate to that velocity.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            		Thus <code>\dfrac{<var>A</var>\cdot 2 }{32 \cdot <var>R</var>}</code> seconds elapsed between the time the whale materialized and the time of your first measurement.
