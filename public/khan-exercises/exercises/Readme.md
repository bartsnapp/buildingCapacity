# Installation for OSX

If you do not have Xcode installed, you must install it. You can get it for free 
[here](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html).

After installing (or verifying that you have) xcode, you need to install rvm. This can be
done by copy and pasting the following command into your terminal:

`\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`

Hopefully, the installation was successful. If it wasn't, I recommend the "google the 
error message" strategy.
