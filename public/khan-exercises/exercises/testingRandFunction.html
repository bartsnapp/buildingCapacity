        <p class="problem">  
         	This week we are introducing a new feature:  The ability to type mathematical expressions as answers!
         	This exercise is just to help you get used to entering such expressions.  We automatically display what you 
         	have written in a nicer to read format below the answer box.  If what is currently typed in is not valid, 
         	that information is also displayed.  Currently, we have more parenthesis displayed than we would like,
         	we will hopefully fix this soon.
         	<br/><br/>
            You can try simplifying the expression
         	before entering it if you want a challenge.  For example if the displayed function is <code>2sin(x+x)*cos(x+x)</code>, then you
         	could simplify this to <code>2sin(2x)cos(2x)</code> and type 2*sin(2*x)*cos(2*x).  If you really are up
         	on your trig, you might recognize that you could simplify further to <code>sin(4x)</code> and write sin(4*x).

        	<p class="question">
        		Type an expression equivalent to 
        		<code><var>LaTeXEXP</var></code>
        	</p>
        <p class="solution" data-type="parsedExpression">
        	<var>EXP</var>

        		One expression you could type which works is <var>EXP</var>
